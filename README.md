# Code_Wars_tryouts

this repo shows the history of my progress in learning PYTHON coding and also allowed me to become familiar with git and GitHub. The platform I used is [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/)

If you want, you can follow the process of finding a solution to each task by browsing the commits. The difficulty system of CodeWars tasks is numerical: from the easiest (kata 8) to the most difficult (kata 1). In this repo you will find kata in the range 7 -> 5. While solving one of the tasks at kata level 5, I came across the term "dynamic programming", which inspired me to explore this topic and for subsequent tasks I created a repo: CodeWars_kata_5

The system I used when searching for tasks was related to my level according to [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/). That is, if I was at level 6, I solved kata 6. I usually chose tasks that brought something new to my education, and sometimes I took the easy way and looked for simpler ones. Life:)

If you are interested in my account and achievements on CodeWars, here is a link to my profile on this platform (earlier in my studies I used leetcode.com and hackerrank.com but then I was not in the habit of documenting my progress)
